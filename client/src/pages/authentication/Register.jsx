//this component is the auth component in the readme. despite the name, this will allow the user to either register or log in, which will change dynamically depending on the state of the localStorage token in the browser's client(see readme). Use conditional rendering set by buttons to swap between the display for the register form and the login form.

import React from "react";

export default function Register() {
  return <div>Register</div>;
}
